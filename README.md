Technologies Used
Frontend Technologies
React: Used for building the component structure, React’s component-based approach allows the footer to be modular, reusable, and easy to integrate into larger web projects.
React Router: Provides seamless navigation support (if needed in a larger app context), allowing the component to be part of a multi-page React application.
CSS Modules: CSS Modules help style the footer in a scoped and conflict-free manner. By keeping styles modular, the component remains isolated, preventing CSS conflicts.
Tailwind CSS (if applicable): This utility-first CSS framework enhances styling with fast, responsive, and easily customizable design options.
Other Tools
Git: Version control is managed with Git, enabling collaboration and tracking changes to the component’s codebase.
GitHub: Used for hosting and sharing the code, making collaboration easy.
